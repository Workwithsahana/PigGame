Pig game is a Fun Game.
Pig is a simple dice game where two or more players take turns rolling a single die. Each roll adds to the player's turn score, but rolling a 1 resets the turn score to zero and ends the player's turn. The player can choose to hold and add their turn score to their total score. The first player to reach a set score threshold wins the game.
